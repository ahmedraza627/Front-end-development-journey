            <h3>Historical Performance of Pakistan’s Stock Market (KSE-100 Index)</h3>
            <p>Over the years, the Pakistan Stock Exchange <b>(PSX)</b> has outperformed several other investment
                classes.
                <b>KSE-100 Index,</b> which represents the top companies in Pakistan, has shown an <b> average
                    compounded annual
                    return of 11.92%</b> over the past decade.
            </p>

            <p>Several factors contribute to the stock market’s performance:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Economic growth and corporate earnings.</li>
                <li>Government policies and market regulations.</li>
                <li>Investor confidence and foreign investments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While the stock market does experience short-term fluctuations, historical trends indicate that long-term
                investors benefit significantly from capital appreciation and dividends.</p>

            <h3>Stocks vs. Real Estate: Which Investment Offers Higher Returns?</h3>

            <p>Real estate is often viewed as a safer investment compared to stocks due to its tangible nature. However,
                when
                comparing returns, stocks have consistently outperformed real estate in the long run.</p>

            While real estate provides stability, stocks offer flexibility and potential for exponential growth, making
            them
            a
            more attractive option for those seeking higher returns.

            <b>Comparing Stocks with Gold, Bonds, and Mutual Funds</b>

            <br>
            <p>Apart from real estate, investors often consider gold, bonds, and mutual funds for wealth preservation
                and
                growth.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gold:</strong>
                    <p>Traditionally used as a safe-haven asset. While it holds value during economic crises, it lacks
                        passive
                        income generation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bonds:</strong>
                    <p>Offer fixed income but have lower returns compared to stocks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mutual Funds:</strong>
                    <p>Provide diversification and professional management but charge management fees.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Among these, stocks remain the most dynamic investment option, offering both capital appreciation and
                income
                generation through dividends.</p>
